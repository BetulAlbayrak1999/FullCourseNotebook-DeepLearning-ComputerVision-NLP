### Deep Neural Network for Airline Delay Classification

This notebook implements a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using Keras and TensorFlow to predict significant weather-related airline delays based on historical flight data. The dataset is preprocessed to remove irrelevant columns and handle missing values. A binary classification target (`WDCase`) is derived from the `weather_delay` column. The model includes multiple dense layers with various activation functions and uses the AdamW optimizer for training. The notebook also includes model evaluation using validation accuracy and training history plots.
